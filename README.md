# Tracey Walker School of Dance dynamic timetable

https://tracywalker-e9ae2.firebaseapp.com/

This project was initially to help me remember when my daughter's dance lessons were going to take place.
Previous to this there was no single source of truth for everybody (parents and teachers) to know when/where dance lessons were scheduled to take place.  Multiple locations and often last minute timetabling changes.

With this project, Tracey can simply update the CMS (google sheets for now) and the dance community need only to look at this page to get upto date information.

## TODO
- The title should be read from the sheet, not hardcoded at 2019
- fix the spinning icon!
